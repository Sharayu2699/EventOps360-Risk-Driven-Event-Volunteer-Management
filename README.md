**EventOps360: Risk-Driven Event & Volunteer Management**

EventOps360 is an operational analytics dashboard built on **Tableau Cloud** to help event managers proactively assess event readiness, identify risk, optimize volunteer capacity, and evaluate budget efficiency.

This project was built as a **solo submission** for the Tableau Hackathon and is inspired by real-world challenges observed during my internship at the Office of Student Volunteerism (OSV).

**Problem Statement**

Event operations often rely on fragmented data sources. Attendance forecasts, volunteer availability, budget planning, and risk assessment are typically analyzed in isolation, making it difficult to identify issues early and take timely action.

EventOps360 addresses this gap by bringing these elements together into a single, risk-driven operational view designed to support real decision-making.

---

**What the Project Does**

EventOps360 enables users to:

- Assess overall event readiness at a glance  
- Identify high-risk events requiring immediate attention  
- Analyze volunteer load relative to attendance demand  
- Evaluate budget efficiency versus event impact  
- Interact with data using filters, KPIs, and cross-sheet actions  

Rather than static reporting, the dashboard functions as an **event operations control center**.

**How It Was Built**

- **Platform:** Tableau Cloud  
- **Tools & Capabilities Used:**
  - Tableau Calculated Fields
  - Semantic Modeling
  - Interactive Filters and Dashboard Actions
  - KPI-Based Views
  - Risk, Efficiency, and Readiness Metrics

Each dashboard component was intentionally designed to answer a specific operational question, with all views connected through shared logic to ensure consistent and actionable insights.

## Dataset

The project uses **public New York City event-related data** to model a high-volume, complex event environment.

NYC was selected due to its diverse and large-scale event landscape, making it an ideal context for analyzing event risk, volunteer coordination, and operational efficiency at scale.

---

## Key Metrics & Logic

- **Event Risk Level:** Derived from attendance variance, volunteer availability, and cost indicators  
- **Volunteer Efficiency:** Attendance supported per volunteer hour  
- **Event Readiness:** Comparison of actual versus forecasted attendance  
- **Budget Efficiency:** Cost per attendee relative to event impact  

These metrics are consistently applied across all dashboard views.

## Accomplishments

- Built an end-to-end actionable analytics solution independently  
- Connected event risk, attendance, volunteer capacity, and budget into a single workflow  
- Designed an executive-ready dashboard focused on operational decisions  
- Delivered a production-style Tableau Cloud solution within hackathon timelines  

---

## What I Learned

This project reinforced the importance of designing analytics around **decisions rather than raw metrics**. Semantic consistency, thoughtful interactivity, and clear visual hierarchy significantly improve the usability and impact of analytics solutions.

---

## Project Status

EventOps360 was completed as a solo project during the Tableau Hackathon and is fully functional on Tableau Cloud.

All dashboards, KPIs, filters, and interactions are finalized and work as demonstrated in the demo video. The current version represents a complete, submission-ready solution focused on actionable analytics and operational decision-making.

---

## Future Improvements

With additional time, EventOps360 could be extended to include:
- Predictive risk scoring for upcoming events  
- Automated alerts for volunteer shortages or budget overruns  
- Role-based dashboard views for different stakeholders  
- Deeper integrations with scheduling and communication tools
